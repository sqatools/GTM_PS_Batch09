# Output= ((4, 7), (6, 1), (8, 4))
# Input lists:
list1 = [4, 6, 8]
list2 = [7, 1, 4]

for i in list1:
    for j in list2:
        print((i,j))

print(dir(tuple))

# Output=
# q
# o




# 11). Python tuple program to check whether an element exists in a tuple or not.
# Input = ( ‘p’ ,’y’, ‘t’, ‘h’, ‘o’, ‘n’)
# P in A
# Output=
# True




# 12). Python tuple program to add a list in the tuple.
# Input:
# L=[12,67]
# A=(6,8,4)
# Output:
# A=(6,8,4,12,67)




# 13). Python tuple program to find sum of elements in a tuple.
# Input:
# A=(4,6,2)
# Output:
# 12




# 14). Python tuple program to add row-wise elements in Tuple Matrix
# Input:
# A = [[(‘sqa’, 4)], [(‘tools’, 8)]]
# B = (3,6)
# Output:
# [[(‘sqa’, 4,3)], [(‘tools’, 8,6)]]




# 15). Python tuple program to create a tuple having squares of the elements from the list.
# Input = [1, 9, 5,  7, 6]
# Output = (1, 81, 25, 49, 36)




# 16). Python tuple program to multiply adjacent elements of a tuple.
# Input = (1,2,3,4)
# Output =  (2,6,12)




# 17). Python tuple program to join tuples if the initial elements of the sub-tuple are the same.
# Input:
# [(3,6,7),(7,8,4),(7,3),(3,0,5)]
# Output:
# [(3,6,7,0,5),(7,8,4,3)]




# 18). Python tuple program to convert a list into a tuple and multiply each element by 2.
# Input = [12,65,34,77]
# Output = (24, 130, 68, 154)




# 19). Python tuple program to remove an item from a tuple.
# Input:
# A=(p,y,t,h,o,n)
# Output: (p,y,t,o,n)




# 20). Python tuple program to slice a tuple.
# Input:
# A=(5,7,3,4,9,0,2)
# Output:
# (5,7,3)
# (3,4,9)
